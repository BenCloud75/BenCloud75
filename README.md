### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am a French API designer and Cloud lover based in Paris. 

Since 2016, I have been working on various IT projects, from SAP implementations to API Design for the travel industry. When Covid hit the planet and significantly impacted my industry (travel), I started to self-train on Cloud solutions. I bought my first servers in 2020 and started creating my own self-hosted applications for my day to day activities. This experience made me understand the huge potential of the Cloud for the years to come.

I am a tech lover and would love to help people taking back the control of their personal data. Also, I believe any company should accelerate their move to the cloud and adopt and API-centric vision to increase their overall productivity.
